### 1. AI Models Now Detect Dementia With High Accuracy Using EEG Signals

*   **Link:** `https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251127/New-AI-models-detect-dementia-with-high-accuracy-using-EEG-signals.aspx`
*   **Summary:** This article discusses two new AI models developed by researchers at Örebro University that can detect dementia with high accuracy using EEG (electroencephalogram) signals. The first model, which combines temporal convolutional networks and LSTM networks, can distinguish between healthy individuals, Alzheimer's patients, and those with frontotemporal dementia with over 80% accuracy. The second model, which is smaller and designed for privacy using federated learning, achieves over 97% accuracy. The research also focuses on explainable AI, allowing doctors to understand the basis for the AI's diagnosis. The goal is to provide a rapid, low-cost, and privacy-safe tool for the early diagnosis of dementia.

### 2. New Study Finds Hybrid Human + AI Teams Outperform Fully Autonomous Agents by ~69%

*   **Link:** `https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-new-stanford-carnegie-study-hybrid-1562759/`
*   **Summary:** This article analyzes a recent study by Stanford University and Carnegie Mellon University that compares the performance of fully autonomous AI agents with hybrid human-AI teams. The study found that while AI agents are significantly faster and more cost-effective, they have a high failure rate (32.5%–49.5% lower success rates than humans). In contrast, hybrid workflows, where humans and AI collaborate, improve overall performance by 68.7%. The article concludes that for high-stakes professions like law and medicine, a hybrid, multimodal approach with strong human oversight is the most effective and safest way to use AI.

### 3. Virginia sets new limits on AI chatbots for minors

*   **Link:** `https://dig.watch/updates/virginia-sets-new-limits-on-ai-chatbots-for-minors`
*   **Summary:** This article reports on the legislative efforts in Virginia to regulate the use of AI chatbots by minors. Lawmakers are concerned about the potential for harm, especially in therapeutic or emotional support contexts. The proposed legislation aims to restrict what conversational agents can say in these interactions and redirect users to human help when dangerous language is detected. The article also mentions other AI-related legislative efforts in Virginia, including a bill to require labels for synthetic media and to block AI systems from buying event tickets in bulk.
